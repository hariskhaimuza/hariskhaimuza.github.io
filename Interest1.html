    		<h2>Play guitar</h2>
    		<p style="width:80%">I love playing guitar, but only acoustic guitar. Usually, i play guitar to release my stress or when i have free time. I can play guitar while singing which makes me happy and forget about my problems. My favourite song to play is called Kamado Tanjiro No Uta by Go Shiina. I just play the fingerstyle version of the song because it makes me satisfy and it is a very fun song to play. Here i play it for you, happy listening!</p>
